# THM-SOC-LEVEL-1-PATH

## Introduction
This repository documents my journey toward becoming a successful Security Operations Center (SOC) Tier 1 Analyst.

I am following the SOC Level 1 learning path on TryHackMe to build the core skills required for entry-level SOC roles, including security monitoring, alert analysis, incident handling, and threat detection.

Through hands-on labs and practical exercises, this journey focuses on developing real-world defensive security skills essential for working in a SOC environment.
